# My Portfolio

## Description
For this project, I needed to make sure that this page was able to generate a random, secure, password for employees. I used JavaScript to complete this. I was able to learn more about pseudo coding, variables, functions, for loops, and if statements. I also learned how the 'confirm' and 'prompt' functions work, and also how to convert string data to number data. I needed to do this in order for my user defined password length to be converted to it's representative number. For example, if a user inputs that they want their password to be 12 characters long, I used the !Number.isInteger(length) function for this. This took me some time to figure out but ultimately helped me learn something new!
